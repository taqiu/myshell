P536-myshell
============

The first lab assignment is to write your own shell in C (or C++). 
The program you will write has these requirements. 

• It will be started with the command myshell [ prompt ]. If the 
optional prompt is not specified, the prompt will be ”myshell: ". 

• It will read in the line of commands that will consist of 
executables, arguments and the tokens “<”, “>”, “>>”, “&”, “;”
and “|”

• You will then create all of the necessary processes with the 
proper redirection of input and output. 

• The shell should exit when the user types CTRL-D or exit

• Implement “cd” as a shell builtin
